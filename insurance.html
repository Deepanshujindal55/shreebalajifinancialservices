        <h1>Types of Insurance: </h1>
        <h3>Broadly There are different types of insurance some of them are explained below: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li class = "insurimp">
               <b><i> LIFE INSURANCE :-</i></b>Life Insurance protects the people that are dependent on you. If your parents, spouse, children, or other loved ones would face financial hardship if you died, life insurance should be high on your list of required insurance policies. Think about how much you earn each year and purchase a policy to replace that income in the event of your untimely demise.  
        </li><br><br>
        <li class = "insurimp">
            <b><i>HEALTH INSURANCE :-</i></b>The soaring cost of medical care is reason enough to make health insurance a necessity. Even a simple visit to the family doctor can result in a hefty bill. More serious injuries that result in a hospital stay can generate a bill that tops the price of a one-week stay at a luxury resort. Injuries that require surgery can quickly rack up five-figure costs. Although the cost of health insurance is a financial burden for just about everyone, the potential cost of not having coverage is much higher. 
        </li><br><br>
        <li class = "insurimp">
            <b><i>AUTOMOBILE INURANCE :-</i></b>Some level of automobile insurance is required by law in most places. Even if you are not required to have it, and you are driving an old clunker that has been paid off for years, automobile insurance is something you shouldn't skip. If you are involved in an accident and someone is injured or their property is damaged, you may be subject to a lawsuit that could cost you everything you own. Accidents happen quickly and the results are often tragic. Having no automobile insurance or purchasing only the minimum required coverage saves you only a tiny amount of money and puts everything else you own at risk.
        </li><br><br>
        <li class = "insurimp"><b><i>TRAVEL INSURANCE :-</i></b>
            Travel insurance covers the costs and losses associated with traveling, including trip cancellations or delays, coverage for emergency health care, injuries and evacuations, damaged baggage, rental cars, and rental homes.However, even some of the best travel insurance companies do not cover cancellations or delays due to weather, terrorism, or a pandemic. They also don't often cover injuries from extreme sports or high-adventure activities.
